module WordNumber where
import Data.List (intersperse)

digitToWord :: Int -> String
digitToWord n = undefined

digits :: Int -> [Int]
digits n = undefined

wordNumber :: Int -> String
wordNumber n = undefined

-- Here undefined is a placeholder to show you where you need to fill in the functions.
-- The n to the right of the function names is the argument which will be an integer.

-- Fill in the implementations of the functions above so that wordNumber returns the
-- English word version of the Int value. You will first write a function that turns
-- integers from 1-9 into their corresponding English words, ”one,” ”two,” and so on.
-- Then you will write a function that takes the integer, separates the digits, and
-- returns it as a list of integers. Finally you will need to apply the first function
-- to the list produced by the second function and turn it into a single string with
-- interspersed hyphens.

-- We’ve laid out multiple functions for you to consider as you tackle the problem.
-- You may not need all of them, depending on how you solve it–these are just suggestions.
-- Play with them and look up their documentation to understand them in deeper detail.
-- You will probably find this difficult.

-- div :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
-- mod :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
-- map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
-- concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
-- intersperse :: a -> [a] -> [a]
-- (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
-- (:[]) :: a -> [a]

-- Also consider:
-- Prelude> div 135 10
-- 13
-- Prelude> mod 135 10
-- 5

-- Prelude> div 13 10
-- 1
-- Prelude> mod 13 10
-- 3

-- Here is what your output should look in the REPL when it’s working:
-- Prelude> wordNumber 12324546
-- "one-two-three-two-four-five-four-six"
-- Prelude>
